Temperature Conversion Program This programming task has been assigned by Prodigy Infotech as part of the software development internship.

Description The Temperature Unit Converter is a simple Python program that allows users to convert temperatures between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin scales. With this program, users can easily input a temperature value along with the original unit of measurement, and the program will swiftly convert the temperature to the other two units and display the converted values.

Features Converts temperatures between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin scales. User-friendly interface with prompt-based input. Accurate and efficient conversion calculations. Provides clear and easy-to-read converted temperature values. How to Use Clone this repository to your local machine using git clone. Navigate to the project directory. Run the program using a Python interpreter: python temperature_converter.py. Follow the prompts to input a temperature value and the original unit of measurement. The program will display the converted temperature values in the other two units. Example Suppose you input a temperature of 25 degrees Celsius:

Temperature Conversion Program Enter the temperature value: 25 Enter the original unit (Celsius, Fahrenheit, or Kelvin): celsius

25.00 Celsius is equivalent to: 77.00 Fahrenheit 298.15 Kelvin
